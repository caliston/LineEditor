This software is provided as is - it has been tested to a reasonable extent,
but probably has a few lurking bugs.  I take no responsibility for any loss
or damage, directly or indirectly caused.

UNIX is a trademark of AT&T; 4DOS is a trademark of JP Software Inc.
Incidentally, I highly recommend 4DOS if you have to use DOS.

Versions with a letter suffix are test versions and may only be distributed
with express permission from me.  Other versions may be distributed freely
provided all files are supplied intact and that no profit is made.  You may
bundle it with other freeware software provided these distribution
restrictions are met, but please make sure you're supplying the latest
version.  If you want to distribute it in some other way, get in touch.
